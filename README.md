1.Project Overview Give a concise summary of your project:
Title: Retail Store Data Analytics
Objective: Clean, model, and visualize retail data for actionable insights.
Tools Used: Python (for cleaning), SQL (for modeling), Power BI (for visualization).

2.Data Cleaning (Python) Describe the key cleaning steps you performed:
Handled missing values using fillna() or dropna().
Standardized column names for consistency.
Removed duplicates and filtered outliers.
Converted data types (e.g., datetime formatting). Include the cleaned dataset or scripts in a folder like /data_cleaning.

3.Data Modeling (SQL) Explain how you structured the data:
Created tables for sales, products, customers, and transactions.
Used joins to merge datasets.
Applied aggregation functions (SUM(), AVG()) for key metrics.
Designed indexes for query optimization. Store SQL scripts in a /sql_queries folder.

4.Data Visualization (Power BI) Summarize the dashboards:
Sales Performance: Revenue trends, best-selling products.
Customer Insights: Demographics, purchase patterns.
Store Metrics: Profitability, stock levels. Save .pbix files in /visualizations.
